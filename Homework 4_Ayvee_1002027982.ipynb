    "Step 1: Import os, request module, sqlite3 for database connection and beautiful soup library for pulling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Check if commodity_prices.txt file already exists in your system or not, if found remove inside contents and open it or if not found create a file in that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Check if there is any existing database under your given db name, if yes remove it and if not found create it. Use try-except to create that database under your given name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Create a object with Cursor class so that it can invoke methods which execute SQLite statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Create table with the column name Ticker and Price, Ticker datatype is TEXT and Price datatype is REAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Now call the website's url using requests library and save in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 7: Define a function that will parse the commodity price from saved website's data, commodity name will be sent as parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 8: Make a list of all commodities which will be searched. Now we have to fetch price, write it in a file and use it in that created db.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 9: Use a for loop to iterate through items from previously created list (step 8). then write the Commodity Name and Commodity Price in the file; get the commodity price using the price_of_commodities function (defined in step 7). Insert the commodity name in as Ticker and commodity price as Price; by calling price_of_commodities function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 10: Commit all changes in db, close cursor and close db connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 11: Now check by querying if your created db is giving write output or not. Import pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 12: Close your connection to db after checking as in next run it will give error if keep opened."
